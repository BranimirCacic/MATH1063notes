    <title>Upper Bounds and Lower Bounds </title>

    <introduction>
        <p>
            In <xref ref="sec-prob-area"/>, we derived the area of a planar region by obtaining better and better upper and lower estimates for its true value.
            In this section, we make precise the notion of estimating a number or set of numbers from above (with an <term>upper bound</term>) or below (with a <term>lower bound</term>).
            This, in turn, leads us to consider the notion of <term>least upper bound</term> (optimal upper bound) and <term>greatest lower bound</term> (optimal lower bound), which generalize maximal and minimal element, respectively, of a finite set of numbers.
        </p>
        <p>
            The existence of least upper bounds and greatest lower bounds is a fundamental property of the real numbers that was first identified by <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Bolzano">Bernard Bolzano</url> in the early 19th century.
            It turns out to be <em>the</em> property of real numbers that distinguishes them from the rational numbersâ€”for instance, it's the reason why <m>2</m> has a <em>real</em> square root.
            In differential calculus, it gives rise to the <url href="https://opentext.uleth.ca/apex-calculus/sec_continuity.html#thm_IVT">intermediate value theorem</url> and <url href="https://opentext.uleth.ca/apex-calculus/sec_extreme_values.html#thm_extreme_val">extreme value theorem</url>.
            In this course, it will give rise to the rigorous theory of integration.

        <title>Upper bounds</title>
        <p>
            Consider the set <m>(0,1] = \set{x \in \R}{0 \lt x \leq 1}</m>.
            By definition,  <m>x \leq 1</m> for every <m>x \in (0,1]</m>; thus, <m>1</m> is a simultaneous upper estimate for all numbers in the set <m>(0,1]</m>.
            Likewise, <m>x \leq 2025</m> for every <m>x \in (0,1]</m>); thus, <m>2025</m> is also a simultaneous upper estimate for all numbers in the set <m>(0,1]</m>, if a much cruder upper estimate than <m>1</m>.
            The notion of a simultaneous upper estimate for all numbers in some set of numbers is formalized as follows.

                    Let <m>A</m> be a set of real numbers.
                    An <term>upper bound</term> for <m>A</m> is a real number <m>M</m> such that <m>x \leq M</m> for all <m>x \in A</m>.
                    Thus, we say that <m>A</m> is <term>bounded above</term> if there exists an upper bound for <m>A</m>.

        </remark>

        <example>
            <p>
                The number <m>1</m> is an upper bound for <m>(0,1]</m>, so that <m>(0,1]</m> is bounded above.
                The number <m>2025</m> is also an upper bound for <m>(0,1]</m>.
            </p>
        </example>

        <example xml:id="ex-a1">
            <p>
                Let <m>A_1</m> be the set of all numbers of the form <m>\frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{2n} + \frac{1}{6n^2}</m>, where <m>n \in \N</m> (look familiar?).
                Given <m>n \in \N</m>, since <m>\frac{1}{2n} - \frac{1}{6n^2} = \frac{3n-1}{6n^2} \geq 0</m>, it follows that
                <me>
                    \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{2n} + \frac{1}{6n^2} = \frac{1}{3} - \frac{3n-1}{6n^2} \leq \frac{1}{3}

                Thus, <m>\frac{1}{3}</m> is an upper bound for <m>A_1</m>.

        <remark>
            <p>
                To show that a set of real numbers <m>A</m> is <em>not</em> bounded above, you need to show that every would-be upper bound <m>M</m> fails to be an upper bound for <m>A</m>.
                More precisely, you need to show that for every <m>M \in A</m>, there exists some <m>x \in A</m> such that <m>x \gt M</m>.
            </p>
        </remark>

        <example>
            <p>
                The set of all real numbers <m>\R</m> is not bounded above.
                Indeed, let <m>M \in \R</m> be given.
                Then <m>x \defn M+1</m> satisfies <m>x \in \R</m> and <m>x > M</m>.
            </p>
        </example>

        <p>
            Note that the upper bound <m>1</m> for <m>(0,1]</m> gives you more information than the much larger upper bound <m>2025</m>.
            For example, the fact that <m>1</m> is an upper bound for <m>(0,1]</m> lets you conclude that <m>2 \notin (0,1]</m> since <m>2 \gt 1</m>.
            By contrast, since <m>2 \leq 2025</m>, the larger upper bound <m>2025</m> is too crude to detect that <m>2 \notin (0,1]</m>.
            Thus, we formalize the notion of an optimal upper bound.

                    Let <m>A</m> be a set of real numbers that is bounded above, and let <m>M</m> be a real number.
                    We say that <m>M</m> is the <term>least upper bound</term> or <term>supremum</term> of <m>A</m> whenever it satisfies both of the following conditions:

                    If <m>A</m> has a least upper bound, then it is unique, so that the notation <m>\sup A</m> is unambiguous.

                    Suppose that <m>M_1</m> and <m>M_2</m> are both least upper bounds of a set of real numbers <m>A</m>.
                    On the one hand, since <m>M_1</m> is a least upper bound and <m>M_2</m> is an upper bound, it follows that <m>M_1 \leq M_2</m>.
                    On the other hand, since <m>M_2</m> is a least upper bound and <m>M_1</m> is an upper bound, it follows that <m>M_2 \leq M_1</m>.

            There's a nice special case where you can find the least upper bound of a set without any trouble.

                We'll prove this by contradiction.
                Assume for the sake of argument that <m>\N</m> is bounded above.
                Then <m>\N</m> is non-empty (<eg/>, since <m>1 \in \N</m>) and bounded above (by assumption), so that <m>\N</m> has a least upper bound <m>\sup \N</m>by <xref ref="axiom-suprema"/>.

                Now, let <m>m \in \N</m> be given.
                Since <m>m+1 \in \N</m>, it follows that <m>m+1 \leq \sup\N</m>, hence <m>m \leq \sup\N - 1</m>.
                Since <m>m \in \N</m> was arbitrary, this shows that <m>M \defn \sup N - 1</m> is also an upper bound.
                Thus, <m>M</m> is an upper bound of <m>\N</m> that satisfying <m>M \lt \sup N</m>, which contradicts the definition of <m>\sup N</m>.

                Then <m>x \defn m-1</m> satisfies <m>x \in \R</m> and <m>x \lt m</m>.
            </p>
        </example>

        <p>
            Much like before, we can formalize a notion of <em>optimal</em> lower bound.
        </p>

        <definition xml:id="def-infimum">
            <statement>
                <p>
                    Let <m>A</m> be a set of real numbers that is bounded below, and let <m>m</m> be a real number.
                    We say that <m>m</m> is the <term>greatest upper bound</term> or <term>infimum</term> of <m>A</m> whenever it satisfies both of the following conditions:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <m>m</m> is an lower bound for <m>A</m>;
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                if <m>m'</m> is any other lower bound for <m>A</m>, then <m>m \geq m'</m>.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    Hence, we denote the greatest lower bound <m>M</m> of <m>A</m> by <m>\sup A</m>.
                </p>
            </statement>
        </definition>

        <note>
            <p>
               Uniqueness of greatest lower bounds follows from a qualitatively identical argument to uniqueness of least upper bounds. 
            </p>
        </note>

        <example>
            <p>
                The lower bound <m>0</m> of <m>(0,1]</m> is its greatest lower bound, <ie/>, <m>0 = \inf (0,1]</m>.
                Indeed, let <m>m \gt 0</m>; we'll show that <m>m</m> cannot be a lower bound for <m>(0,1]</m> by demonstrating <m>x \in (0,1]</m> such that <m>x \lt m</m>.
                If <m>m \gt 1</m>, then <m>x \defn 1 \in (0,1]</m> satisfies <m>x \lt m</m>.
                If, instead, <m>0 \lt m \leq 1</m>, then <m>x \defn \frac{m}{2} \in (0,1]</m> satisfies <m>x \lt m</m>.
            </p>
        </example>

        <p>
            The most important single example of a greatest lower bound is the following.
        </p>

        <proposition xml:id="prop-inf-harmonic">
            <statement>
                <p>
                    Let <m>S</m> be the set of all numbers of the form <m>\frac{1}{n}</m>, where <m>n \in \N</m>.
                    Then <m>\inf S = 0</m>.
                </p>
            </statement>
            <proof>
                <p>
                    Since <m>S</m> consists of positive numbers, it follows that <m>0</m> is a lower bound for <m>S</m>.
                    Now, let <m>m \gt 0</m> be given; we'll show that <m>m</m> cannot be a lower bound by demonstrating <m>x \in S</m> such that <m>x \lt m</m>.
                    Indeed, by <xref ref="cor-archimedean-real"/>, there exists <m>N \in \N</m> such that <m>\frac{1}{N} \lt m</m>.
                    Then <m>x \defn \frac{1}{N} \in S</m> satisfies <m>x \lt m</m>.
                </p>
            </proof>
        </proposition>

        <example xml:id="ex-a2-inf">
            <p>
                One can now show that <m>\frac{1}{3}</m> is the greatest lower bound of the set <m>A_2</m> of <xref ref="ex-a2"/>.
                Indeed, one can very easily modify the argument of <xref ref="ex-a1-sup"/> into a proof identical in structure to that of <xref ref="prop-inf-harmonic"/>.

            Every fact about (least) upper bounds has a corresponding fact about (greatest) lower bounds.
